Hadoop 2.x has the following three Major Components:
HDFS.
YARN.
MapReduce.

In Hadoop 2.x major key component change is YARN.
Hadoop 2.x Components High-Level Architecture
 
•	All Master Nodes and Slave Nodes contains both MapReduce and HDFS Components.
•	One Master Node has two components:
•	Resource Manager
•	HDFS
It’s HDFS component is also knows as NameNode. 
NameNode is used to store Meta Data.
Resource Manager:
•	Resource Manager is again divided into two components:
•	Scheduler
•	Application Manager

Resource Manager’s Scheduler is :
•	Responsible to schedule required resources to Applications (that is Per-Application Master).
•	It does only scheduling.
•	It does care about monitoring or tracking of those Applications.
Application Manager
•	Managing assigned Application Life cycle.
•	It interacts with both Resource Manager’s Scheduler and Node Manager
•	It interacts with Scheduler to acquire required resources.
•	It interacts with Node Manager to execute assigned tasks and monitor those task’s status.
Node Manager:
It is responsible for:
•	Managing the life-cycle of the Container.
•	Monitoring each Container’s Resources utilization.

Container:
•	Each Master Node or Slave Node contains set of Containers. In this diagram, Main Node’s Name Node is not showing the Containers. However, it also contains a set of Containers.
•	Container is a portion of Memory in HDFS (Either Name Node or Data Node).
